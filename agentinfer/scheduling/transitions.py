"""Typed boundary for strategy-requested, runtime-owned Program transitions.

``TransitionRequest`` describes an admit, queue, pause, delayed pause, resume, or release against an exact
generation-safe ``ProgramRef``. ``TransitionResult`` reports whether host runtime accepted it and links the matching
event. ``TransitionController`` is constructed for one synchronous Strategy Hook while the caller holds the scheduling
lock. This module does not select candidates, calculate capacity, acquire locks, or implement the Program state
machine: the host runtime callback validates current state and performs the mutation.
