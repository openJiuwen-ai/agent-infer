"""Mutable policy-owned values that provide the basis for scheduling decisions.

This module does not define the runtime's ``ProgramState`` lifecycle. ``StrategyFactors`` stores global measurements
and per-Program values used by a policy to compare admission, resume, pause, and release choices without adding them to
the shared Program model. Runtime facts remain in Program records and immutable snapshots; factors contain only the
policy's rolling statistics, counters, timestamps, weights, or flags derived from those facts.

The host runtime owns one factor collection and passes it directly to strategy Hooks while holding the same lock that
serializes core Program transitions. A strategy updates factors only after the corresponding transition is accepted, so
a separate copy-on-write view, commit protocol, version, or rollback wrapper would duplicate synchronization semantics
and could incorrectly discard earlier factor updates from a partially accepted fixed plan.
