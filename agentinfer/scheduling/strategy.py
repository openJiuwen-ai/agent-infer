"""Scheduling policy extension point and lifecycle callback dispatcher.

``SchedulingStrategy`` is the package's intentional abstract surface. For each decision, the caller holds its
scheduling lock and passes one immutable ``SchedulingSnapshot``, one policy-owned ``StrategyFactors``, and one lock-scoped
``TransitionController`` directly to the Hook. A concrete policy computes a complete admission, post-completion yield,
resume, or capacity-repair plan from that fixed snapshot and updates its local capacity projection after each applied
transition; it does not refresh runtime state during the Hook. Committed runtime events use a separate single callback
path so strategy accounting is not applied twice.

The base class defines no score, capacity threshold, host runtime I/O, mutable Program operation, or concrete policy fields.
It also exposes ``next_check_at()`` and ``handle_scheduled_check()`` as an optional timer contract: the caller may
start a new locked Hook with a fresh snapshot at the requested monotonic deadline, rather than scheduling a future
transition from stale decision factors.
