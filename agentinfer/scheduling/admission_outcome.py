"""Synchronous forwarding-gate outcome returned by the admission Hook.

Admission is the only scheduling Hook whose caller needs an immediate aggregate disposition: the host runtime must either
open the request's forwarding gate or keep it in the waiting pool. Resume and capacity-repair Hooks express their work
through individual transition results, committed scheduling events, and strategy diagnostics, so they do not require
parallel outcome types. ``AdmissionOutcome`` also carries the capacity inputs and exact Program transitions needed to
explain how the Hook reached its final forwarding decision.
